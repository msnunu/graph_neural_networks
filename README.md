# graph_neural_networks
this repository will include the parts where I put into practice what I have learned about graph neural networks. From creating a graph, that is, from zero to hero:)

- example output from askı_memnu graph.ipynb

![askı_memnu_graph](https://github.com/msnunu/graph_neural_networks/assets/124269047/c7cae12d-d21c-4c58-b44e-73c8c121d82c)

- Single Source Shortest Path Algorithms: I focused on two algorithms to understand&learn&practice the basic logic. these
   * dynamic programming>> bellman-ford algorithm
   * greedy method>> dijkstra algorithm
